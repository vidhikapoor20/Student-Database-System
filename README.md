# Student-Database-System
Created an automated Student Database System for a school using PL-SQL to replace their Manual system which was used by the administration. The main objective was to develop a robust Student Database Management System for the school. The main purpose of the project was to build an integrated student database system to facilitate easy access of records of students across departments. The Student database system allows the registrar of the school to edit, to update and list personal and academic details of students. It also enhances efficient management of student's information. This system also intends to allow students to view their results online. This goes a long way to help students decide on what courses to register. The system intends to manage specific information of students such as personal details, course details and exam details. The system stores semester details, course details, department details and all the details of the students including their background information, educational qualifications etc.
